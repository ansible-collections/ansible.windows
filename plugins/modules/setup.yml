DOCUMENTATION:
  module: setup
  short_description: Gathers facts about remote hosts
  seealso:
    - module: ansible.builtin.setup
  options:
    gather_subset:
      description:
        - If supplied, restrict the additional facts collected to the given subset.
        - Can specify a list of values to specify a larger subset.
        - Values can also be used with an initial C(!) to specify that that specific subset should not be collected.
        - To avoid collecting even the min subset, specify C(!all,!min).
        - To collect only specific facts, use C(!all,!min), and specify the particular fact subsets.
      type: list
      elements: str
      default: all
    gather_timeout:
      description:
        - Set the default timeout in seconds for individual fact gathering.
      type: int
      default: 10
    fact_path:
      description:
        - Path used for local ansible facts (C(*.ps1) or C(*.json)) - files in this dir
          will be run (if a ps1) or read (if a json) and their results be added to the return facts.
        - The returned fact will be named after the local file (without the extension suffix), e.g. C(ansible_my_fact).
      type: path
    _measure_subset:
      description:
        - For internal use
      type: bool
      default: false
  description:
    - This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful
      variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also be
      executed directly by C(/usr/bin/ansible) to check what variables are
      available to a host. Ansible provides many I(facts) about the system,
      automatically.
  notes:
    - More ansible facts will be added with successive releases. If I(facter) is
      installed, variables from these programs will also be snapshotted
      into the JSON file for usage in templating. These variables are prefixed
      with C(facter_) so it's easy to tell their source. All variables are
      bubbled up to the caller.
    - Some facts may be unavailable if running under a limited account.
    - For more information about delegated facts,
      please check U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegating-facts).
