module: win_powershell
version_added: 1.5.0
short_description: Run PowerShell scripts
description:
- Runs a PowerShell script and outputs the data in a structured format.
- Use M(ansible.windows.win_command) or M(ansible.windows.win_shell) to run a tranditional PowerShell process with
  stdout, stderr, and rc results.
options:
  arguments:
    description:
    - A list of arguments to pass to I(executable) when running a script in another PowerShell process.
    - These are not arguments to pass to I(script), use I(parameters) for that purpose.
    type: list
    elements: str
  chdir:
    description:
    - The PowerShell location to set when starting the script.
    - This can be a location in any of the PowerShell providers.
    - The default location is dependent on many factors, if relative paths are used then set this option.
    type: str
  creates:
    description:
    - A path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path exists on the target host, the task will be skipped.
    type: str
  depth:
    description:
    - How deep the return values are serialized for C(result), C(output), and C(information[x].message_data).
    - This also controls the depth of the diff output set by C($Ansible.Diff).
    - Setting this to a higher value can dramatically increase the amount of data that needs to be returned.
    default: 2
    type: int
  error_action:
    description:
    - The C($ErrorActionPreference) to set before executing I(script).
    - C(silently_continue) will ignore any errors and exceptions raised.
    - C(continue) is the default behaviour in PowerShell, errors are present in the I(error) return value but only
      terminating exceptions will stop the script from continuing and set it as failed.
    - C(stop) will treat errors like exceptions, will stop the script and set it as failed.
    choices:
    - silently_continue
    - continue
    - stop
    default: continue
    type: str
  executable:
    description:
    - A custom PowerShell executable to run the script in.
    - When not defined the script will run in the current module PowerShell interpreter.
    - Both the remote PowerShell and the one specified by I(executable) must be running on PowerShell v5.1 or newer.
    - Setting this value may change the values returned in the C(output) return value depending on the underlying .NET
      type.
    type: str
  parameters:
    description:
    - Parameters to pass into the script as key value pairs.
    - The key corresponds to the parameter name and the value is the value for that parameter.
    type: dict
  removes:
    description:
    - A path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path B(does not) exist on the target host, the task will be
      skipped.
    type: str
  script:
    description:
    - The PowerShell script to run.
    type: str
    required: true
seealso:
- module: ansible.windows.win_command
- module: ansible.windows.win_shell
notes:
- The module is set as failed when a terminating exception is throw, or C(error_action=stop) and a normal error record
  is raised.
- The output values are processed using a custom filter and while it mostly matches the C(ConvertTo-Json) result the
  following value types are different.
- C(DateTime) will be an ISO 8601 string in UTC, C(DateTimeOffset) will have the offset as specified by the value.
- C(Enum) will contain a dictionary with C(Type), C(String), C(Value) being the type name, string representation and
  raw integer value respectively.
- C(Type) will contain a dictionary with C(Name), C(FullName), C(AssemblyQualifiedName), C(BaseType) being the type
  name, the type name including the namespace, the full assembly name the type was defined in and the base type it
  derives from.
- The script has access to the C($Ansible) variable where it can set C(Result), C(Changed), C(Failed), C(Diff),
  or access C(Tmpdir).
- C($Ansible.Result) is a value that is returned back to the controller as is.
- C($Ansible.Diff) was added in the C(1.12.0) release of C(ansible.windows) and is a dictionary that is set to the diff
  result that can be interepreted by Ansible.
- C($Ansible.Changed) can be set to C(true) or C(false) to reflect whether the module made a change or not. By default
  this is set to C(true).
- C($Ansible.Failed) can be set to C(true) if the script wants to return the failure back to the controller.
- C($Ansible.Tmpdir) is the path to a temporary directory to use as a scratch location that is cleaned up after the
  module has finished.
- C($Ansible.Verbosity) reveals Ansible's verbosity level for this play. Allows the script to set VerbosePreference/DebugPreference
  based on verbosity. Added in C(1.9.0).
- Any host/console output like C(Write-Host) or C([Console]::WriteLine) is not considered an output object, they are
  returned as a string in I(host_out) and I(host_err).
- The module will skip running the script when in check mode unless the script defines
  C([CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]).
