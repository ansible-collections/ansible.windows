  dependencies:
    description:
    - A list of service dependencies to set for this particular service.
    - This should be a list of service names and not the display name of the
      service.
    - This works by C(dependency_action) to either add/remove or set the
      services in this list.
    type: list
    elements: str
  dependency_action:
    description:
    - Used in conjunction with C(dependency) to either add the dependencies to
      the existing service dependencies.
    - Remove the dependencies to the existing dependencies.
    - Set the dependencies to only the values in the list replacing the
      existing dependencies.
    type: str
    choices: [ add, remove, set ]
    default: set
  desktop_interact:
    description:
    - Whether to allow the service user to interact with the desktop.
    - This can only be set to C(true) when using the C(LocalSystem) username.

      C(win32_own_process) or C(win32_share_process).

  error_control:
    description:
    - The severity of the error and action token if the service fails to start.
    - A new service defaults to C(normal).
    - C(critical) will log the error and restart the system with the last-known
      good configuration. If the startup fails on reboot then the system will
      fail to operate.
    - C(ignore) ignores the error.
    - C(normal) logs the error in the event log but continues.
    - C(severe) is like C(critical) but a failure on the last-known good
      configuration reboot startup will be ignored.

    - normal
    - severe
    type: str
  failure_actions:
    description:
    - A list of failure actions the service controller should take on each

    - The service manager will run the actions from first to last defined until
      the service starts. If I(failure_reset_period_sec) has been exceeded then
      the failure actions will restart from the beginning.
    - If all actions have been performed the the service manager will repeat
      the last service defined.
    - The existing actions will be replaced with the list defined in the task
      if there is a mismatch with any of them.
    - Set to an empty list to delete all failure actions on a service
      otherwise an omitted or null value preserves the existing actions on the

        - C(none) will perform no action, when used this should only be set as
          the last action.
        - C(reboot) will reboot the host, when used this should only be set as

    - If specifying C(LocalSystem), C(NetworkService), C(LocalService), the C(NT SERVICE), or a gMSA this field can be
      omitted as those accounts have no password.
    type: str
  pre_shutdown_timeout_ms:
    description:
    - The time in which the service manager waits after sending a preshutdown
      notification to the service until it proceeds to continue with the other

    - win32_own_process
    - win32_share_process
    type: str
  sid_info:
    description:
    - Used to define the behaviour of the service's access token groups.
    - C(none) will not add any groups to the token.
    - C(restricted) will add the C(NT SERVICE\<service name>) SID to the access
      token's groups and restricted groups.

    type: str
  start_mode:

    choices: [ auto, delayed, disabled, manual ]
  state:
    description:
    - The desired state of the service.
    - C(started)/C(stopped)/C(absent)/C(paused) are idempotent actions that will not run
      commands unless necessary.
    - C(restarted) will always bounce the service.
    - Only services that support the paused state can be paused, you can
      check the return value C(can_pause_and_continue).
    - You can only pause a service that is already started.
    - A newly created service will default to C(stopped).
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, paused, started, stopped, restarted ]
  update_password:
    description:
    - When set to C(always) and I(password) is set, the module will always report a change and set the password.
    - Set to C(on_create) to only set the password if the module needs to create the service.
    - If I(username) was specified and the service changed to that username then I(password) will also be changed if
      specified.
    - The current default is C(on_create) but this behaviour may change in the future, it is best to be explicit here.
    choices:
    - always
    - on_create
    type: str
  username:
    description:
    - The username to set the service to start as.
    - Can also be set to C(LocalSystem) or C(SYSTEM) to use the SYSTEM account.
    - A newly created service will default to C(LocalSystem).
    - If using a custom user account, it must have the C(SeServiceLogonRight)
      granted to be able to start up. You can use the M(ansible.windows.win_user_right) module
      to grant this user right for you.
    - Set to C(NT SERVICE\service name) to run as the NT SERVICE account for that service.
    - This can also be a gMSA in the form C(DOMAIN\gMSA$).
    type: str
notes:
- This module historically returning information about the service in its return values. These should be avoided in
  favour of the M(ansible.windows.win_service_info) module.
- Most of the options in this module are non-driver services that you can view in SCManager. While you can edit driver
  services, not all functionality may be available.
- The user running the module must have the following access rights on the service to be able to use it with this
  module - C(SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG), C(SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS), C(SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG), C(SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS).
- Changing the state or removing the service will also require futher rights depending on what needs to be done.
