## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.15**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.

## Collection Documentation

Browsing the [**latest** collection documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/windows) will show docs for the _latest version released in the Ansible package_ not the latest version of the collection released on Galaxy.

Browsing the [**devel** collection documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/ansible/windows) shows docs for the _latest version released on Galaxy_.

We also separately publish [**latest commit** collection documentation](https://ansible-collections.github.io/ansible.windows/branch/main/) which shows docs for the _latest commit in the `main` branch_.

If you use the Ansible package and don't update collections independently, use **latest**, if you install or update this collection directly from Galaxy, use **devel**. If you are looking to contribute, use **latest commit**.

## Installation and Usage

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the Windows collection, you need to install it with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: ansible.windows
```

You can run the collection's test suites with the commands:

    ansible-test sanity --docker
    ansible-test windows-integration --docker


## Publishing New Version

The current process for publishing new versions of the Windows Core Collection is manual, and requires a user who has access to the `ansible` namespace on Ansible Galaxy and Automation Hub to publish the build artifact.

* Update `galaxy.yml` with the new version for the collection.
* Update the `CHANGELOG`:
  * Make sure you have [`antsibull-changelog`](https://pypi.org/project/antsibull-changelog/) installed `pip install antsibull-changelog`.
  * Make sure there are fragments for all known changes in `changelogs/fragments`.
  * Add a new `release_summary` fragment: `echo "release_summary: Release summary for v..." > changelogs/fragments/release-summary.yml`
  * Run `antsibull-changelog release`.
* Commit the changes and wait for CI to be green
* Create a release with the tag that matches the version number
  * The tag is the version number itself, and should not start with anything
  * This will trigger a build and publish the collection to AH and Galaxy
  * The Zuul job progress will be listed [here](https://ansible.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/builds?project=ansible-collections%2Fansible.windows&skip=0)

After the version is published, verify it exists on the [Windows Core Collection Galaxy page](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible/windows).
