  0.2.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - setup - Make sure ``ansible_date_time.epoch`` is seconds since EPOCH in UTC
        to mirror the POSIX facts. The ``ansible_date_time.epoch_local`` contains
        seconds since EPOCH in the local timezone for backwards compatibility
      - setup - Will now add the IPv6 scope on link local addresses for ``ansible_ip_addresses``
      - setup - ``ansible_processor`` will now return the index before the other values
        to match the POSIX fact behaviour
      - win_find - No longer filters by size on directories, this feature had a lot
        of bugs, slowed down the module, and not a supported scenario with the ``find``
        module.
      bugfixes:
      - Fix detection of DHCP setting so that resetting to DHCP doesn't cause ``CHANGED``
        status on every run. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66450
      - setup - Remove usage of WMI to speed up execution time and work with standard
        user accounts
      - win_acl - Fixed error when setting rights on directory for which inheritance
        from parent directory has been disabled.
      - win_dns_client - Only configure network adapters that are IP Enabled - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58958
      - win_dsc - Always import module that contains DSC resource to ensure the required
        assemblies are loaded before parsing it - https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/66
      - win_find - Fix deduped files mistaken for directories (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58511)
      - win_find - Get-FileStat used [int] instead of [int64] for file size calculations
      - win_package - Handle quoted and unquoted strings in the registry ``UninstallString``
        value - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/40973
      - win_reboot - add ``boot_time_command`` parameter to override the default command
        used to determine whether or not a system was rebooted (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58868)
      - win_share - Allow for root letters paths
      - 'win_uri win_get_url - Fix the behaviour of ``follow_redirects: safe`` to
        actual redirect on ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65556'
      deprecated_features:
      - win_domain_computer - Deprecated the undocumented ``log_path`` option. This
        option will be removed in a major release after ``2022-07-01``.
      - win_regedit - Deprecated using forward slashes as a path separator, use backslashes
        to avoid ambiguity between a forward slash in the key name or a forward slash
        as a path separator. This feature will be removed in a major release after
        ``2021-07-01``.
      minor_changes:
      - Checks for and resolves a condition where effective nameservers are obfucated,
        usually by malware. See https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/06/02/crouching-tiger-hidden-dns/
      - Windows - add deprecation notice in the Windows setup module when running
        on Server 2008, 2008 R2, and Windows 7
      - setup - Added `ansible_architecture2`` to match the same format that setup
        on POSIX hosts return. Unlike ``ansible_architecture`` this value is not localized
        to the host's language settings.

        subset can run for

        from a URL - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35377

  1.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - "win_find - module has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the
        ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:\n  * When the directory specified
        by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will
        just warn the user\n  * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``,
        use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches
        the win_stat module\n  * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches
        the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties
        in correctly reporting the size of a directory\n"
      - win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``description`` to be case sensitive
      - win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``fullname`` to be case sensitive

      - win_package - the ``ensure`` alias for the ``state`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``state`` instead of ``ensure``.
      - win_package - the ``productid`` alias for the ``product_id`` option has been
        deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``product_id``
        instead of ``productid``.
      - 'win_package - the ``username`` and ``password`` options has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. The same functionality can be done
        by using ``become: yes`` and ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials logon_flags=netcredentials_only``
        on the task.'

      deprecated_features:
      - 'win_reboot - Unreachable hosts can be ignored with ``ignore_errors: True``,
        this ability will be removed in a future version. Use ``ignore_unreachable:

        used.
