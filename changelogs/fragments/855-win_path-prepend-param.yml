    The ``ansible.windows.win_path`` module now supports a ``prepend`` parameter.
    When set, the specified path elements are enforced as an ordered block at the
    beginning of the target environment variable. Existing matching elements are
    moved to the front while preserving the user-defined order, and repeated runs
    are idempotent when the desired order is already satisfied.
