    win_find - module has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
      * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
      * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the win_stat module
      * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
deprecated_features:
  - win_domain_controller - the ``log_path`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. This was undocumented and only related to debugging information for module development.
  - "win_package - the ``username`` and ``password`` options has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. The same functionality can be done by using ``become: yes`` and ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task."
  - win_package - the ``ensure`` alias for the ``state`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``state`` instead of ``ensure``.
  - win_package - the ``productid`` alias for the ``product_id`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``product_id`` instead of ``productid``.
removed_features:
  - win_stat - removed the deprecated ``get_md55`` option and ``md5`` return value.
