bugfixes:
- setup - Fallback to using the WMI Win32_Processor provider if the SMBIOS version is too old to return processor core counts
- setup - Fix calculation for ``ansible_processor_threads_per_core`` to reflect the number of threads per core instead of threads per processor
- setup - Ignore processors that are not enabled in the ``ansible_processor_count`` return value
- setup - Support core and thread counts greater than 256 in ``ansible_processor_count`` and ``ansible_processor_threads_per_core``
