  win_regedit - Removed support for using a ``path`` with forward slashes as a key separator. Using a forward slash has
  been deprecated since Ansible 2.9. If using forward slashes in the ``win_regedit`` ``path`` value, make sure to
  change the forward slash ``/`` to a backslash ``\``. If enclosed in double quotes the backslash will have to be
  doubled up.
