bugfixes:
- win_reboot - User defined commands are run wrapped as a PowerShell command so they work on all shells - https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/36
- win_reboot - Ensure documented return values are always returned even on a failure
- win_reboot - Handle more connection failures during the reboot phases

minor_changes:
- >-
  win_reboot - Change the default ``test_command`` run after a reboot to wait for more services to start up before the
  plugin finished. This should better handle waiting until the logon screen appears rather than just when WinRM is
  first online.

deprecated_features:
- >-
  win_reboot - Unreachable hosts can be ignored with ``ignore_errors: True``, this ability will be removed in a future
  version. Use ``ignore_unreachable: True`` to ignore unreachable hosts instead. - https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/62

removed_features:
- win_reboot - Removed ``shutdown_timeout`` and ``shutdown_timeout_sec`` which has not done anything since Ansible 2.5.
